    "# 2. Intro to Choropleth Maps <a id = '2'></a>\n",
    "A choropleth overlay, or choropleth map, is a type of map which uses color to represent statistical information. Choropleth maps can be used to convey information such as population density, poverty rates, unemployment rates, or in our case, police incidents. They are often used when visualizing a statistic that varies geographically. Through the use of mapping techniques, a choropleth overlay can succintly represent geographical differences between areas. Below is an example of a choropleth map that shows the unemployment rate by state - later on in the lab, we will create our own choropleth map based on the police incidents data.\n",

    "A colormap is a collection of colors that are used to represent sequences of information on a given scale. Matplotlib has many different colormap options, but there are a lot of things to keep in mind when choosing a colormap beside which one looks the prettiest. Matplotlib has a [useful guide](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) for choosing colormaps. Some things to keep in mind:\n",

    "In order to set a colormap option, we will provide an arugment to the `cmap` option in matplotlib. For example: `cmap = 'viridis'` sets the colormap to follow the viridis pattern as seen above. Colormap options are split into several categories based on function, and different options may convey different meanings. For example, one may want to use a different colormap when plotting qualitative data with no particular order, than when plotting diverging data where information deviates around a meaninful point. In folium, colormaps are set with the parameter `fill_color`, and there are limited supported colormaps. They are as follows: 'BuGn', 'BuPu', 'GnBu', 'OrRd', 'PuBu', 'PuBuGn', 'PuRd', 'RdPu', 'YlGn', 'YlGnBu', 'YlOrBr', and 'YlOrRd'."
